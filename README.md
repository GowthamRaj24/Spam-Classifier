# Basic Spam Classifier
### Overview
This repository contains a basic spam classifier implemented in Python. The classifier uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

### Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF , BagofWords.
- Classification using machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
